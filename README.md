# DDoS-Godian

**DDoS-Godian** is a lightweight DDoS protection system designed to handle small-scale DDoS attacks. While it may not yet achieve the high-performance goals of handling millions of requests per minute, it offers foundational protection and logging functionality. This project is now open for the community to improve and enhance its capabilities.

## Features

- **Basic DDoS Mitigation**: Handles up to 60 requests per minute.
- **Logging**: Tracks IP addresses and attack patterns for review.
- **Simple Admin Access**: Basic admin login functionality (Admin: Admin by default).
- **No Centralized Management**: Currently operates as a standalone server without distributed support.
- **No Modern Dashboard**: The system does not include an advanced graphical dashboard, but outputs logs in the terminal.
